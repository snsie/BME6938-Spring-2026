    "\n",
    "Supervised learning pairs labeled examples with an algorithm that learns how to map inputs to outputs. Once trained, the model can make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key pieces**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset**: collection of examples we care about.\n",
    "- **Features (`x`)**: measurable inputs like heart rate, pixels, or number of people on each track.\n",
    "- **Labels (`y`)**: correct answers provided by humans, instruments, or previous experiments.\n",
    "- **Model**: algorithm (decision tree, neural net, etc.) that learns a mapping from features to labels.\n",
    "- **Training**: process of adjusting the model based on data so predictions get closer to true labels.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: how we score the model’s predictions (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error) to decide if it is good enough or needs improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification vs. regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification predicts categories (e.g., \"tumor is benign or malignant\").\n",
    "- Regression predicts continuous numbers (e.g., blood glucose level in mg/dL).\n",

    "Implement and evaluate a simple heuristic baseline for Titanic survival using a dataframe called df. Assume df includes the columns survived, sex, age, and pclass, even if the values are missing or inconsistently formatted. Define a function predict_survival(row) that predicts survival by returning 1 if the passenger is female (case-insensitive), otherwise returning 1 if the passenger’s age can be parsed as a number and is under 15, and returning 0 in all other cases. Convert both age and survived to numeric using pd.to_numeric(..., errors=\"coerce\"), add the predictions to the dataframe as a new column called rule_pred using df.apply(..., axis=1), and compute accuracy only for rows where survived is not missing. Finally, print the accuracy with a clear label and display the first 10 rows showing survived, sex, age, pclass, and rule_pred.\n"

Use the features pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, fare, and embarked, with survived as the label. Create a clean modeling dataframe containing only these columns, convert all numeric fields and the label to numeric values using pd.to_numeric(..., errors=\"coerce\"), and apply simple, transparent imputation by filling missing numeric values with the median and missing categorical values with the mode (or \"unknown\" if no mode exists), ensuring categorical strings are lowercased. Drop any rows with missing labels, one-hot encode the categorical variables so they can be used by a decision tree, and then construct the feature matrix X and label vector y. Finally, print the shape of X, display the distribution of the labels, and show the first few rows of X, keeping the code clean and readable for instructional use.\n"
